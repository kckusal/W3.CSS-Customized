# W3.CSS Customized
W3.CSS is a light-weight, extremely efficient, modern responsive CSS framework with no external dependencies (no jQuery or JavaScript). To quote the creaters [w3schools.com](https://www.w3schools.com/w3css/default.asp), "W3.CSS is free to use. No licence is necessary." As a result, I customized certain things mentioned below for my personal use. I use it on my websites on a regular basis and find it very convenient, quick, and extendible to meet my development needs.

## What is W3.CSS and why is it interesting?
W3.CSS is a modern CSS framework with built-in responsiveness. It supports responsive mobile first design by default, and it is smaller and faster than similar CSS frameworks.

W3.CSS can also speed up and simplify web development because it is easier to learn, and easier to use than other CSS frameworks. Another reason it is interesting for me is that W3.CSS is Normalized; this makes W3.CSS display HTML consistently in all browsers, and in line with modern web standards.

## What makes this customization more powerful?
**Concise langugage syntax**
- In original library, we have to use 'w3-\*' to use any class modifier, but the initial 'w3-' part is removed in my customized version. For example, to use red background, we would use 'w3-red' class modifier using original library, but with this customized version, we only need to use 'red' as class modifier.

**Very flexible class modifiers**
- The class modifiers are very flexible in original library by itself, but this customization adds to this flexibility by modifying certain properties in some class modifiers and by merging some of the modifiers too.

_*Note*_ All the original class modifiers can be found at [w3schools.com/w3css](https://www.w3schools.com/w3css/default.asp) with fully explained use cases. This should be taken as reference to use this customized version as the class modifiers are same in both.

**New additional modifiers added to meet web design needs and trends**
- The original library lacks some important and regularly needed UI components for interface building which other frameworks easily provide. To keep up with this and still not make our framework any more bulky (for light-weightness is its best quality), I've added some general components with feasibility to use other class modifiers to improvise on them. An example would be burger menu component. This is available in this customized version with 'burger-menu' class modifier, but not in original library.

That being said, I repeat that this customized version is for my personal use, but anyone willing to give it a try is wholeheartedly welcome. And again, I would like to direct all gratitudes to the original developers.
